# Pain points
- chaining applications
- dev dependencies (normalize or whatever)
- automatic documentation
- task dependency
- automatic unsubscribe
- errors can be hard to resolve (google search isn't great)
- when you fix a bug and it creates a new bug
- spaghetti code
- boilerplate folder structure
- remembering syntax for loops, etc.
