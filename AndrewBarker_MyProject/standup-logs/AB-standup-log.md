# Stand-up log for Andrew Barker

## Jan 18th

Last time, I worked on brainstorming and researching project ideas. Coding js in logic x, 
and learning max msp. All for the purpose of learning to make music in programming

Today, I'm going to work on figuring github stuff out.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:
- i'm confused
- not sure i cloned git folder properly. will look for help.
