# Pain points
- chaining applications
- dev dependencies (normalize or whatever)
- automatic documentation
- task dependency
- automatic unsubscribe
- errors can be hard to resolve (google search isn't great)
- when you fix a bug and it creates a new bug
- spaghetti code
- boilerplate folder structure
- remembering syntax for loops, etc.
trying to keep all homework assignments etc straight...like a shared calendar for when projects are due on blackboard 


Wed Jan 25 Personal Pain Points

Pain Point 1: I don't get to make as much music as in the past

step 1: learn how coding applies in logic or other formats/programs. Request guidance from peers who know.
step 2: code snippets of music and influence midi plugins.
step 3: research more methods and tools.
step 4: test and see what can be improved.

Pain Point 2: I receive too many linkedIn job postings to read.

step 1: research how to filter email.
step 2: find out what i want to filter out, and put in sub folder.
step 3: review results and confirm it's working.
step 4: tweak filters.

Pain Point 3: Setting up Boiler plate slows me down.

step 1: establish requirement for templates for some different projects
step 2: create some templates with folders, sub folders, and blank files that are pre linked.
step 3: save in folder, ready to be copied for new projects.
step 4: tweak after use.


Pain Point 4: Worried I won't remember to post all my logs, get work reviewed by peer, and complete 
all my requirements for HTTP 5214.

step 1: create reminder alert for myself to post.
step 2: have an alert sent to my peer group whenever i upload something new to my class folder, and
request a code review.
step 3: review if its working. ie: i'm getting peer reviews.
step 4: think about ways to improve.
