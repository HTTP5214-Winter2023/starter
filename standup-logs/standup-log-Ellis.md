This week we learned how to use Github and broke out into groups to discuss pain points we could potentially develop solutions to. 

Jan 23 ---

Last week we had a discussion about pain points that we could potentially work to fix in our workflows.

This week we had our first scrum meeting and discussed the research we would need to conduct to create our extension. We reviewed github functionality and discussed making a new Kanban board.

Last week we had our first scrum meeting.

We continued our discussion on implementing extensions in VS code. 
We created our team Kanban board and began filling out to do items. 

Feb 8 --- 

 We discussed the need for researching how to code an extension on VS code. 
 This week I will continue this research.

This week we determined the design and flow of our extension. Determined what we would need to code to create the MVP. 
Created a wireframe of the extension's GUI.

Feb 22 ---

Downloaded and tested our stopwatch extension (first code written by Bassil).
Planned out future steps in the creation process.

Today I worked on converting the saved time that the user stops the timer at into a CSV format. This CSV data will be used to record the time on an excel file on the user's computer.

Today we discussed and refined our idea for the user journey that our user will follow when using the extension. In particular, we decided that it would make more sense if the saved time data is saved to a Google Sheets file instead of Excel since it is more likely that our users will have access to Google sheets versus Excel.  
This week I will work on researching the Google Sheets API to achieve this.

This week I worked on trying to find the API necessary for exporting the user's saved time (in a CSV format) to a Google Sheets file in the cloud. This did not work out...
Decided that instead of saving the CSV to Google Sheets, will work on saving the CSV data to a local .csv file that exists on the user's local computer. 
Will work on this function this week.

This week worked on "the saving CSV data" function. Tested and confirmed that csv download functionality works on my own branch. 
This week will merge code to the main branch and test functionality.

April 5 ---

Worked on testing the download csv functionality when merged with the main branch. 
Successful when a local file exists that matches the path defined in the extension code.
Next steps would be to have the extension create a new csv file for the time data to be saved to (as opposed to having a csv file ready on the computer)
