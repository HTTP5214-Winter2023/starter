# Stand-up log for Beatrice Tan

## Jan 16th

Last time, I worked on learning about this course and how to work in collaborative environments

Today, I'm going to work on uploading this. I cloned the repository, created a branch with my name, and made a pull request.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:

- unfamiliar with git / confused

I have to:

- learn how to pull and merge
- learn more about git

## Jan 18th

Last time, I worked on figuring out pain points for the program

Today, I'm going to work on learning Git.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:

- being unfamiliar with git
- responsibilities

## Jan 25th

Last time, I worked on coming up with pain points in web development.

Today, I'm going to work on writing timesheets.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:

- difficulties from other subject's lab

# February 8, 2023

#### This week, I:

- researched on how to round up timers in JavaScript by 15 minutes.
- also studied how to use Git more since I was still confused.
- created the KanBan board for my teammates on Trello

Kanban Trello: https://trello.com/b/1HwBY8jy/vscode-time-extention

My personal notes: https://www.notion.so/Workshops-5214-64ae3511cf524caebb17419a2dcacfa9

### Meetings

### Lead by: Ellis Chang

- Identify which language to code: JavaScript
- Research on how to create extension to vs code.

#### This week, I:

- researched on different Timesheets tracker or stopwatch extensions on vs code. I was able to find a link that has similarities with what we wanted to do but it was written in TypeScript. I gave the link to Anthony, the scrum master. Anthony and Bassil suggested that they will look into the TypeScript language and the code. For me, this is a good foundation and guide towards on how and where we will start with the code.
  This is the code: https://github.com/AlexBlade/vscode-time-tracker
- Here is also another similar extension plugin I saw, however it doesn't have a gitHub code.

- On my own, I was also researching more on how other people have coded a timetracker or stopwatch (functionalities, asking chatGPT how he will make it and made some suggestions to the group)
- I also researched Clockify. It helps get a time tracking extension for VS Code with API key settings. It looks easier to navigate and the design is clean. It looks helpful so I might have to do my personal in-depth research with this one and on how to apply it to our timetracking extension.

## Meetings

### Lead by: Anthony Ho

- Suggestion: To make a copy button to copy the time and the title given for the stopwatch. (similar to when you clone on the github with link name and copy button beside it)
- The team discussed and collaborated on the potential design and MVPs of the stopwatch.
- Team discussed that Trello board was not efficient because we usually talk on WhatsApp and Discord. Although I would personally update it just for documentation, and I also diligently write notes on the Google Document that Ellis created.
- Simon also suggested to research on csv to JSON. I discovered that each xlsx tabs will create an individual csv file. Even when CSV has their own tab, it will create a sub-csv file.

# February 22, 2023

#### This week, I:

- was the scrum master.
- successfully assigned tasks to members on what functions they have to do.
- research on the UI of extensions. Basically I will research more about this during the reading week.
- was more concerned in leading the team to successfully clone the repository onto their own machines. There was some debugging that Bassil and I had to fix during the entire meeting.

## Meetings

### Lead by: Beatrice Tan

- Assigned tasks to group members
- Bassil has successfully coded a timer app.
- Each member of the team are required to clone the main repository (Bassil's code) to their own local machine (acquire a copy of the code in their own computer) by the end of the day.
- Identify the MVPs: Start and stop function of the timer was already coded.
- Bassil will only just have to update the clear timer functionality. He did an amazing job on stepping up and creating an initial code for timer/stopwatch for the timesheets
- Beatrice will: research on the UI to how to make the thing look prettier, and how to make it attached on the left. More front-end. Researching more on clockify.
- Anthony will research on how to make things saved on a specific place.
- Ellis is going to research on how to update the timer into the excel sheet
- Rami will research on how to code a copy button and input a textbox to create a "FileName"
- Reached out to members having difficulty with git and being lost with the overall updates of the team. Guided the members for everybody to be on the same page.

## Work

#### This week, I:

Researching on: I am researching on how to add webview. I experimented writing a webview.html, webview.css, and separate webview.js and of course it did not work. So this code is not going to push through.

Blockers: I think there's too much GUI assigned on me

## Meetings

### Lead by: Rami

- We were doing our own code remotely

## Work

#### This week, I:

- was able to code the GUI however it is not the same as we imagined it to be.
- Researching on: I am researching on how to add webview
  Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/11/webview-ui-toolkit
- I also modified the code in Package.json to add the webview for the TimeCheaters.

Blockers: I think there's too much GUI assigned on me. I am stressing out.

# March 15, 2023

## Meetings

### Lead by: Bassil

- We were doing our own code remotely. I was doing my experimenting.
- Copy button idea was scrapped

## Work

#### This week, I:

- I personally pushed my code to my own branch and asked feedback for it. The sidebar panel is appearing on the right instead of the left side. I still can't figure out how I can fix that.

# March 22, 2023

## Meetings

### Lead by: Beatrice

- Beatrice was doing the user-testing to 5 people. Anthony helped Beatrice to user-test for a bit, and helped Rami debug his Git connections.
- Ellis and Rami are doing their code.
- Bassil not in class. He doesn't have to.

Blockers: I think there's too much GUI assigned on me.

#### This week, I:

- did user testing
- studied more of TouchGrass extension's code. I wanted to implement the visuals that the developer has made, with the reset button and touch grass button (except for ours it will be the start button). It was written in typescript. It shouldn't be that far from javascript. Still, everything is making me cross eyed.

# March 29, 2023

## Meetings

### Lead by: Bassil

- Bassil and Beatrice were the only ones who showed up in person.

Blockers: The webview is really frustrating me. Nobody wants me to push my code to main since it's not 100% working with the keyboard functionality.
This workshops is demotivating. I reached out to professors for help. I do not know other professional coders who can do the code.

#### This week, I:

- considered of coding something else like "did you mean to save this?"

# April 5, 2023

## Meetings

### Lead by: ~

- Bassil and Beatrice were the only ones who showed up in person.
- Ellis was able to finalize his CSV Functionality and pushed his code to main.

Blockers: Still the GUI is a big blocker

#### This week, I:

- considered of coding something else like "did you mean to save this?"
- still attempted to do the GUI (media folder)
- I replaced (stop --> pause) to avoid confusion to people using the timer. I pushed it to main.

# April 12, 2023

## Meetings

### Lead by: Rami

- Rami, Bassil, and Beatrice are in person. Group is discussing possible code for Rami since none of the group realized his code idea was scrapped. I suggested coming from the User Testing Suggestions that maybe he could code the feature "auto start" for when the developer forget to start the timer, and "auto stop" if the person forgot to stop or pause the timer and the VS Code has been idle.
- Rami will be coding a notification that will update the developer "30 minutes has passed", "1 hour has passed" in the timer.

#### This week, I:

- have my code on my branch but not pushed to main (extension.js, and media folder)
