Last time, I worked on coming up with pain points in web development and what I can automate. I decided to look into creating a powershell script that will open up a boilerplate HTML in VS code.

Today, I'm going to work on using Trello and navigating the Kanban board.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:
Understing Git and GitHub.

Last week ...
This week we decided our groups. I chose boilerplate. I chose to be the scrum master.We delegated roles: eg. note taker e.t.c and then decided as a group what tasks we felts we needed in order to create an HTML, CSS and JS boilerplate.

## Feb 1

Sophia Scott was the srum master. We created a repo on git for us to place all our work on there anda kanban board, breaking down each task we need to do for our assignment.

## Feb 7
Tamara was the srum master. We distributed a template script. We update the trello board on what we are doing and what we've done. 
The goal is that everyone can edit the template an personalize it whichever way they want.
