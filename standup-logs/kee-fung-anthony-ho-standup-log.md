- Solved issue with pushing to the repo with Simon Monday, March 6, 2023, that plagued me during the Reading Week
- Code saving feature bit by bit
- Ran into some issues initially but was due to typo
- Code part of function to save time to object, then to a readable time printed out on console (for now)
- Code part of function to reset timer after it is saved
- Discovered a bug of timer; when hours become double digits, minutes have a static zero ("0") showing up before it, i.e. 24:031:02 but this only shows up on the Status Bar and not the time saved, so it might be an issue of that part of the code
