# Stand-up log for Shavin Singh
## Jan 18th

Last time, I worked on Brainstorming ideas for the project. I decide on making a library of scripts of some kind.

Today, I'm going to work on planning out which tools I want to make for
my script library, Some ideas I have are:
-  API OAuth2 Authorization Flows for different apps (Dicord, Spotify, Youtube).
- HTML boilerplate generator (with flags such as jQuery, git, fontawesome)

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:
- Research on what tools to make that will be usefull
- learning bash
